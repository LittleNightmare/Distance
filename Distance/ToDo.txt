Bugs:
	-Aggro range showed up for a brief moment after killing boss in Levi Ex.  Check for monster dead too when deciding whether to show?
		-Check for player dead too.
		-Maybe make the trigger be boss hp <100%, or ideally just boss unaggro'd and not dead if we can find that.
		-This is more complicated than it looks for wipes, and probably requires director info to get it really right.
		-As-is, this can probably only happen with ReAction automatically restoring your focus target, so it's a pretty low priority bug.
	-Some nameplate configurations show all ENpc/companions (0xE0000000) when clicking one.  Not sure how best to solve this.
		-Probably just move distance calculations into draw hook, and compare pointers instead of object IDs.
			-I'm not sure how safe this is with UI mouseover target though, since idk when that hook is entered.
			-Probably only do it when OID is 0xE0000000, which UI mouseover can't be (I think?  What about pets/chocobos?)


Priority:
	-Rate limit download attempts.
		-Github does this for us, no?
	-Offset ring distance by player ring distance too.
		-This will cause confusion when using distance to make decisions on aoe skills, since those are from player center.
		-Maybe the better path forward is to provide an option to offset by ring, and have a help entry that is a discussion of this.
	-Figure out why aoe tooltip distances are inaccurate on some enemies (i.e., striking dummy).
	-Fix how we decide to set whether to use depth.  Surely there's a way to just get it from the nameplate's text node.


Cleanup:
	-Config option strings need to be gone over and made consistent.
	-Make nameplate sig(s) optional.
		-Implemented; just needs testing.
	-Skip some node draw setup (like color, position, whatever calculations) if just hiding the node.  Probably doesn't matter that much, but this plugin's gotten a bit heavy.


Misc:
	-Translations.
	-Maybe add discussions regarding player to ring and ring to ring distances (your skills vs. enemy skills, etc.).


Maybe:
	-Add icon nodes for the range type and boss aggro prefix?  Text versions look a bit ugly/busy, and partially don't work with heavy text mode.
		-Could also have other neat icons like the auto attack one (ui/uld/TargetCursor_hr1.tex) that people could attach.
	-Allow the user to set custom colors for different distance values, like in the aggro widget.
	-Have an alternate drawing method that uses ImGui instead of game UI elements in case people want to hide stuff from capture.
		-Supporting stuff like font options is going to suck; maybe just add it with absolutely minimal support.
	-Provide IPC for others to get aggro data?
		-Also maybe to get the aggro point on line from an enemy.
	-Option to lock aggro widget to the screen-space projection of the aggro point?
	-A text input box to let people format their aggro widget.
		-We need to be really careful to validate the string and allow no format placeholders besides "{0}".
	-Add distances on party list?
	-Add distances to enemy list?
	-Add distance-based coloring to nameplate distances, party distances, etc.?
	-Should make a more encapsulated node (or node controller or something) class before doing the preceeding; it's just getting too much tracking floating nodes with disparate functionality to have even more to do with them.
	-Add friends/fc member conditions for nameplates?


Rejected:
	-Editor for aggro data?
		-Not worth the effort; just use a spreadsheet.
		-Having to deal with potential re-sorts based on edits would be annoying.
	-Add an ImGui window over the text node and track its position to allow for dragging?
		-Not worth the effort for a very minor convenience that will rarely be used.
	-Maybe add option to use caution/warning aggro colors as a gradient rather than just step color changes.
		-Probably more work than it's worth, and starting to get into real feature bloat.
	-ImGui cursor position seems to lag the game's cursor position, making a mouseover widget get wiggly sometimes.
		-This actually seems to happen with the game's cursor itself and game UI windows.
		-Problem fixed if using software cursor in options, so not our problem really.
